# Aurelia-Auth0 

#### Using Auth0 PaaS in the context of the Aurelia applications.

This document is written with the intent to introduce the **[Auth0](https://auth0.com/) PaaS** to [Aurelia](http://aurelia.io/) developers community. Rather than following the [well established path](https://auth0.com/docs) taken by Auth0 and many other platform vendors presenting the mix of samples, tutorials and complete on line documentation, we are continuing the method we pioneered with the **[Aurelia KendoUI bridge catalog](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo/#)** application, which is an extensive, interactive mini development environment, complete will all guides needed to minimize the chance of the newcomer to get lost.
