# Catalog application
Aurelia-UI-Toolkits Catalog application is an instance of our Integrated Teaching Environment designed to simplify the errors and miscommunications typically encountered in the process of getting familiar with a new software tool.

It is likely the best to use our [Aurelia KendoUI Bridge catalog](http://aurelia-ui-toolkits.github.io/demo-kendo/#) application to explain its key set of features.
